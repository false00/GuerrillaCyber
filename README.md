# GuerrillaCyber
GuerrillaCyber is a commandline tool that team's can leverage during an active incident to try and regain control from Attackers. It lives off the land and provides basic utilities such as Active User tracking, Process Killing, and Detection capabilities for the most relevant OS information such as new Scheduled Events and irregular egress traffic.
